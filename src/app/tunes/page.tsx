      Outside of development & design, music holds one of the largest spots in
      my heart. I&apos;ve been playing in bands, touring in ancient vans (not so
      much these days, tho), and recording/producing/mixing songs since I was a
      teenager and am still gigging around town in Portland, OR with my current
      project &apos;Sherbet Tone&apos;. Here&apos;s a sampling of some of my
      favorite tunes from bands I&apos;ve been in.
